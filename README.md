***Simple setup for streaming and saving video from infrared cameras using Raspberry Pis.***

** NOTE: You have to be on HMS Private to use this **

Coming soon: stream video to a computer that hosts it somewhere on the internet where you don't have to be on HMS Private to view your mice

*Requirements:*

- Gstreamer1.0-tools (install with brew or with https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/on-mac-osx.html)
- paramiko (install with conda or pip)

I'll make this a single click executable at some point
