**Simple setup for streaming and saving video from infrared cameras using Raspberry Pis.**

*Requirements:*

- Gstreamer1.0-tools (install with brew or with https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/on-mac-osx.html)
- paramiko (install with conda or pip)

I'll make this a single click executable at some point
